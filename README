Redis-RdbParser version 0.05
============================

Redis::RdbParser is a parser for Redis' rdb dump files. 
The parser generates events similar to an xml sax parser. 

The dump file is parsed sequentially. As and when
objects are discovered, appropriate callbacks 
would be invoked. You can set the callback item `undef`
if you don't care it.
